OK, so I've been working on creating the object based API and am having some
luck in getting things moving.

But I sort of got side tracked making it work generically, which is OKish.

But the object API can be made to work very strictly as I know the object to
use.

Anyway, so I can make this happen. I just have to skip this part of weirdness I
can add to c++ later. a fully generic object to flatbuffer type schema thingo.

I can see implementing flexbuffers int he future.

```gdscript
# returns all properties of object as name:type pairs in a dictionary
var object_props : Dictionary = object.get_property_list().reduce(
	func(a:Dictionary, p:Dictionary) -> Dictionary:
		a[p.name] = p.type; return a, {})
```
OK, object based API is there. it didn't really solve my current problem, but it was easy enough to smash out in a day.
